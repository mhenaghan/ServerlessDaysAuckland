content: "<p>There's only a limited number of seats and from past experience, tickets will sell very fast when we are getting closer to the event. No one knows exactly when that will be the case. We recommend to secure yours when you feel comfortable doing so. The last thing we want is for you to be disappointed because you missed out!</p>"
