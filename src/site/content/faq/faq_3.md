question: "What is the time limit for a refund? I don’t know if I can still attend the event at the new date yet (whenever that will be) and wonder if I should get a refund now and buy another ticket later on.."

content: "<p>We will contact you as soon as we have a new event date. This will be at least 3 months before the conference. You could decide then in order to avoid the small admin fee (see the next question). However, even if you miss that announcement or if the new date doesn’t work for you (or anything else for that matter), we will refund your ticket at no cost to you (again, except for the small admin fee) up to 4 weeks before the conference. Just let us know via email (auckland@serverlessdays.io) and we’ll make it happen.</p>"
