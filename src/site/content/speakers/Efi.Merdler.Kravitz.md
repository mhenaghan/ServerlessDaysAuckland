title: CI/CD in the serverless era
description: "<p>Serverless development introduces a new methodology of how to build real “cloud native” applications or workloads. In monolithic and microservices architectures, it is simple to develop locally and then push the code to the CI/CD pipeline to be integrated and tested with the work of others. It is relatively simple to write and run an integration test as well and use a staging environment like the “real” environment. In some teams, developers are doing all these tasks, but in many, there are dedicated DevOps and QA engineers to continue the process after the developer checks in his code.</p>

<p>Practicing serverless, the developer carries the entire responsibility to do all of the above. In this talk, we’ll share the process and tools we used for CI/CD to our serverless based application at Lumigo.</p>

<p><ul><li>Dev Environment</li>
<li>Testing Methodology</li>
<li>Deployment Pipeline, combining Bash, AWS CLI and Serverless Framework to create a seamless CI/CD pipeline.</li>
<li>Monitoring</li></ul></p>

<p>Let’s discuss good serverless practices.</p>"
