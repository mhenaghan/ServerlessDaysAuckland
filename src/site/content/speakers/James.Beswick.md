title: How Amazon EventBridge transforms serverless development
description: "Event-driven architecture can help decouple services and simplify dependencies as your application grows. Amazon EventBridge provides new options for developers looking to gain the benefits of this approach.<br />
In this session, I’ll explore the typical problems in synchronous architectures and how events provide a new way to communicate between microservices. You’ll see how this allows service teams to become more independent and how it helps developers get their features to users more quickly.<br />
This sessions shows the difference between existing AWS messaging services, how Software-as-a-Service applications can now emit events, and why this is better than polling or web-hook mechanisms. Finally, I will use live coding examples you can immediately use in your serverless applications."
