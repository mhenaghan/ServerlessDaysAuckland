title: What to do with your data in a serverless world
description: "<p>Serverless is one of those buzzwords (like Blockchain and AI) that everyone is talking about, think they got it in the beginning, but by the end/middle of the implementation they realise that they are just scratching the surface and have to refactor everything.</p>
<p>From SMBs to Enterprises, everyone is trying or wants to go serverless first, however many times we don’t hear about what we should do with the data, how to store, where to store it and what options is AWS offering us.</p>
<p>Throughout my presentation I’d like to showcase how Trustpilot is thinking about data storage when creating new applications or migrating old ones together with examples of struggles and learnings from these experiences</p>
<p>Key takeaways:<ul>
<li>Learn what AWS database options to consider when building a new serverless application</li>
<li>Learn what database options you have when you refactor an old application</li>
<li>Learn what is our process at Trustpilot for how to determine how to store data for new or old applications</li></ul></p>"
