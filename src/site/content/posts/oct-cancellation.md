content: "<p>ServerlessDays Auckland - the in-person event that was originally scheduled for April this year - was rescheduled to September and then postponed again to January 28th, 2021. With a very heavy heart, we have now decided to cancel this date.<br>
Planning would need to start in anger shortly with a point of no return (from a financial commitment perspective) approaching very quickly. At this stage, we don't foresee that borders will be open by then and we don't want to get stung by possible attendee limits if there's yet another lock-down situation. Basically, there's still too much uncertainty.</p><p>
We are starting to refund sold tickets, cancel the venue, etc. and will wind down the event. We discussed the option to go for a hybrid or complete virtual event but decided against it to have more flexibility with regards to standing up something again under a combined <a href='https://anz.serverlessdays.io/'>ANZ banner</a> next year.
Obviously, no one knows what the future will look like but based on the success of our first joint <a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/ServerlessDaysANZ/'>online event</a> on the 4th of September, we'd love to continue that previous collaboration and explore in due course what that could look like.</p>

<p>Best wishes from the ServerlessDays Auckland team."
