content: "<p>Yesterday, the ServerlessDays Auckland team made the hard call to postpone the conference from its current April date. </p>
<p>In light of the current situation regarding COVID-19 and with the well-being of our greater community at the centre of our thinking, we feel that this is the best option going forward. </p>
<p>For reference, New Zealand has now twelve confirmed cases. Since Sunday night, new border measures are in place whereby nearly all travellers arriving in New Zealand are required to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>This, combined with a lot of recently updated corporate policies that ban all non-essential travel and institute the cancellation of conference attendances for employees, has made the logistical side for overseas speakers and non-local visitors alike much more difficult. 
We are in awe of people who told us how they would overcome these challenges - often at significant personal cost and inconveniences. </p>
<p>Our decision-making process was also influenced by the organiser's strong desire to provide a first-class event experience that places humans and our interactions with each other at the core and centre of everything: Nothing beats that friendly smile of a fellow attendee, the engaging discussion in person and the shared laughter with new friends. 
Our main concern however was - and will always remain - the safety of all conference attendees. And that is why we are currently working towards a new date in August or later this year - hoping that the COVID-19 issue will be firmly in everyoneâ€™s rearview mirror by then.
At this stage, we like to thank all of our wonderful sponsors who are committed to the ongoing support of ServerlessDays Auckland. We're incredibly grateful for that and literally couldn't do it without you!</p>
<p>Stay safe, thank you for your understanding and watch this space for further updates!
</p>

<p>All the best, <br>
Andreas, Myles, Darshit, Rainer, Sukhans and Ali "
