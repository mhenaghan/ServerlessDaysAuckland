<p>By now, you have likely heard about COVID-19 and are possibly wondering if this is yet another \"event cancellation\" announcement. It is not!<br>
Although we take the risks VERY seriously and continue to monitor the still-evolving situation closely, we do hope that ServerlessDays Auckland 2020 can go ahead on Monday, the 20th of April.</p>
<p>This is aligned with the New Zealand Ministry of Health's advise to not currently alter arrangements for public events such as conferences. For reference: Since the first positive COVID-19 test on 28 February, four additional cases have been reported in New Zealand - the last one on the 7th of March.</p>
<p>While we are exploring various alternative options (including postponing or making it an online conference - either completely or only partially), the organiser team has decided to carry on with the planning of the event until we feel that the situation requires a different course of action. <br>
Needless to say, if we reach that point, we will inform everyone as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We appreciate that this approach might not remove uncertainty for some attendees - in particular non-locals who bought a ticket - and apologise for that. Please contact us if you are one of those and already decided to not attend the event. We will happily refund your ticket. For all others: Many thanks for your ongoing support!</p>

<p>Best wishes from the ServerlessDays Auckland team,<br>
