title: "AWS: Innovator Island: Build a serverless web app for a theme park"
short: "Innovator Island is a popular theme park that’s rolling out a web app for thousands of visitors. The app provides wait times, ride photos, notification alerts, and language translation for visitors. However, the lead developer has disappeared and, in this workshop, you’re part of a development team that’s assembling the pieces left behind. Learn and practice building a scalable serverless web app with limited development resources."
