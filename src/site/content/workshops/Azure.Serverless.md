<ul><li>Use a series of Azure Functions that independently scale and break down business logic to discrete components</li>
<li>Use computer vision algorithms within an Azure Function to accurately detect license plates in car images at scale</li>
<li>Provision and use Cosmos DB as a highly available NoSQL data store for processed data</li>
<li>Create a Logic App that contains a workflow to export processed license plates and conditionally send alerts based on successful or unsuccessful operation</li>
<li>Use App Insights to monitor the serverless topology, observing how well the solution scales when under load</li>
<li>Implement a Continuous Deployment DevOps process to automatically publish changes to Function Apps.</li></ul></p>"
