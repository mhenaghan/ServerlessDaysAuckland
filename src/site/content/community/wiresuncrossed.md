description: "<p>Go Serverless - you know you want to!</p><p>If you were starting a new project today, or overhauling your existing platform, you would be crazy not to implement some or all of it on Serverless technologies and patterns.</p><p>So why isn’t everyone doing it?</p><p>
<br>Well, change can be challenging. When it comes to technology transformations, supporting the people is just as important as the engineering to realise success. That’s where we come in. Wires Uncrossed combines Engineering and Change Management to support your team on their Serverless journey.</p>"
